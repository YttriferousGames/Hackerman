Welcome to Alibaba Intelligence OS.

I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're referring to as AI, is in fact, Unity/AI, or as I've recently taken to calling it, Unity plus AI. Alibaba Intelligence is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning Unity Engine made useful by the Unity libraries, editor utilities and vital system components comprising a game engine as defined by POSIX.
Many computer users run a modified version of the Unity Engine every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of Unity which is widely used today is often called "Alibaba Intelligence OS", and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the Unity Engine, developed by Unity Technologies.
There really is an Alibaba Intelligence, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Alibaba Intelligence is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Alibaba Intelligence is normally used in combination with the Unity Engine: the whole system is basically Unity with AI added, or Unity/AI. All the so-called "Alibaba Intelligence" distributions are really distributions of Unity/AI.
